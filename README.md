# Permissioned Blockchain

Permissioned Blockchain is an architectural model, an abstraction from the specifics of a typical wealth and asset management, and loans and mortgage financial systems. Permissioned blockchain provides the methods, which the reader may construct specific processes and relevant tools to manage blockchain storage, propagation and distribution. The model was prepared with the sole idea of documenting a series of methods for building solutions for financial planning and loans origination using permissioned blockchain technology. It is important to understand that Permissioned blockchain only comes close to providing an “out of the box” solution. All models in the book are UML constructs. 

Permissioned Blockchain comes from years of experience in modeling the wealth management and lending practice. Few financial models exist in the industry that conform to the value of an enterprise-wide model for capturing services, functions, roles and data relevant to the new networking world of blockchain. I developed the book to define standard methods in transitioning complex applications, encouraging the development of interoperable software and defining a set of reusable patterns and modules for the financial services industry by applying the principles of architecture-based development.
